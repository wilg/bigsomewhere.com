						<h3>Wil Gieseler <em>Writer &amp; Director</em></h3>
						<p>Since he started making unlicensed re-enactments of <em>Gilligan's Island</em> in his backyard with just paper cutouts and a video camera, Wil has bled film. Not literally, that would be shocking medically. He does, however, believe that cinema offers a unique and powerful ability to bring stories to life. He hopes one day to be able to tell stories as powerful as the ones he grew up watching on the silver screen.</p>
					</div>
				
					<div class="crewman">
						<h3><a href="http://gregcotten.com">Greg Cotten</a> <em>Cinematographer</em></h3>
						<p>Greg's interest in cinematography first came about when he discovered that his grandfather had developed lenses used in CIA spy satellites. He has been playing around with cameras and lenses constantly ever since. He is a collaborator at heart and strives to find a unique vision for each project he undertakes. </p>
					</div>
				
				
					<div class="crewman">
						<h3><a href="http://andygress.com/">Andy Gress</a> <em>Editor</em></h3>
						<p>Andy was first introduced to filmmaking at the age of five when he started making videos with his sister, her friend, and a cast of stuffed animals. Despite their silliness, these movies encouraged Andy to explore the world of narrative filmmaking. While his true passion is film editing, he has been known to dabble in the arts of cinematography and sound as well.</p>
					</div>
				
					<div class="crewman">
						<h3>Jeanette Sanker <em>Production Designer</em></h3>
						<p>Jeanette's never-ending imagination is always finding new places to go. Her creative mind is perfectly suited for the film industry, where everything she imagines can become reality. She accomplishes this by creating worlds through production design, costuming, and screenwriting, and sometimes by working in the camera department. Jeanette is a senior at Chapman University pursuing a degree in Production Design. She also has plans to make documentaries after she graduates.
